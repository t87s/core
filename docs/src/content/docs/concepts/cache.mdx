description: Why caching is the only cheat code that actually works

Caching is how grown-up systems stay fast without lying. The trick is simple: you keep the expensive work close by, so the next request is a short walk instead of a cross-country flight.

Every serious company does this. The feed that loads instantly? Cached. The dashboard that doesn't spin forever? Cached. The "Continue Watching" row that appears before your coffee cools? Cached. Nobody recomputes that from scratch, because users don't wait and databases don't stretch.

Caching isn't about being clever. It's about being honest. You trade a little staleness for a lot of speed, then you put guardrails around what "stale" even means. That's the whole game.

t87s exists to make that trade explicit. You declare what's allowed to go stale, you invalidate what must not, and you stop guessing.
