Sometimes, when you vacation in Florida, a glitzy salesman corners you with free coffee and a timeshare pitch. In t87s, that time is now.

## Why Cloud?

Look, we built the open-source library because we love caching. We built the cloud because we love money. But also because self-hosting cache infrastructure is a pain in the ass and we're genuinely good at it.

Our cloud is:

**Fast.** Sub-millisecond response times. We're talking 0.3ms p50, 0.8ms p99.

**Scalable.** We're built on Cloudflare using their globally distributed network.

**Smart.** Real-time cache optimization via AI analysis. We analyze your cache patterns and auto-tune TTLs so you don't have to guess.

**Simple.** One API key. No Redis cluster to babysit.

## Benchmarks

| Adapter | p50 | p99 | Ops/sec |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Memory | 0.01ms | 0.05ms | ∞ (local) |
| Redis | 1.2ms | 4.5ms | 50k |
| t87s Cloud | 0.3ms | 0.8ms | 500k |

Yes, we're faster than Redis for a globally distributed app. No, we didn't stack the deck in our favor. Yes, the benchmarks are [open source](https://github.com/t87s/core/tree/main/benchmarks), and you can reproduce them at your leisure.

## The API

Query your cache analytics with SQL via `POST /v1/query`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.t87s.dev/v1/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $T87S_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM verifications LIMIT 10"}'
```

### Available Tables

**`verifications`** - Every cache staleness check.
- `key` (TEXT) - The cache key checked
- `is_stale` (INTEGER) - 1 if stale, 0 if fresh
- `timestamp` (TEXT) - ISO8601 timestamp

**`cache_operations`** - All cache operations.
- `type` (TEXT) - 'hit', 'miss', 'set', or 'invalidate'
- `key` (TEXT) - The affected cache key
- `timestamp` (TEXT) - ISO8601 timestamp

### Example Queries

**Find keys with high stale rates:**
```sql
SELECT key, COUNT(*) as checks, SUM(is_stale) as stale,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(is_stale) / COUNT(*), 1) as stale_pct
FROM verifications
GROUP BY key
HAVING stale_pct > 10
ORDER BY stale_pct DESC
```

**Recent invalidations:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cache_operations
WHERE type = 'invalidate'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Hourly verification volume:**
```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00', timestamp) as hour,
       COUNT(*) as checks
FROM verifications
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC
LIMIT 24
```

## Using with LLMs

The Query Explorer includes a "Prompt for LLMs" button that copies your API key and documentation to your clipboard. Paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any AI assistant to analyze your cache patterns.

Ask questions like:
- "What cache issues do I have?"
- "Which keys have the highest stale rate?"
- "Should I increase the TTL on user:* keys?"

For the supremely lazy and crafty dev, one popular approach is the "dumb cache" - wrap everything in a cache call without any tags, deploy to production, and let it run for 48-72 hours. Then, use the "Prompt for LLMs" button and your favorite AI assistant to analyze your actual traffic patterns and tell you exactly which operations benefit from caching and what TTLs make sense.

## Pricing

**Free tier:** 10k operations/month. No credit card required.

**After that:** $0.001 per operation.

Let's say you have a small SaaS with 50 daily active users. Each user averages 3 sessions per day, and each session hits your cache 10 times. That's 50 × 3 × 10 = 1,500 operations per day, or about 45k per month. Subtract the 10k free tier, and you're at 35k × $0.001 = **$35/month**.

## Get Started

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { CloudAdapter } from '@t87s/core';

    const t87s = new T87s({
      adapter: new CloudAdapter({
        apiKey: process.env.T87S_API_KEY,
      }),
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    from t87s import T87s
    from t87s.adapters.cloud import CloudAdapter

    # pip install t87s[cloud]
    t87s = T87s(adapter=CloudAdapter(api_key=os.environ["T87S_API_KEY"]))
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. Same API you already know. Just faster, smarter, and with someone else waking up at 3am.
