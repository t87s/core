import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Sometimes, when you vacation in Florida, a glitzy salesman corners you with free coffee and a timeshare pitch. In t87s, that time is now.

## Why Cloud?

Look, we built the open-source library because we love caching. We built the cloud because we love money. But also because self-hosting cache infrastructure is a pain in the ass and we're genuinely good at it.

Our cloud is:

**Fast.** Sub-millisecond response times. We're talking 0.3ms p50, 0.8ms p99.

**Scalable.** We're built on Cloudflare using their globally distributed network.

**Smart.** Real-time cache optimization via MCP. We analyze your cache patterns and auto-tune TTLs so you don't have to guess.

**Simple.** One API key. No Redis cluster to babysit.

## Benchmarks

| Adapter | p50 | p99 | Ops/sec |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Memory | 0.01ms | 0.05ms | ∞ (local) |
| Redis | 1.2ms | 4.5ms | 50k |
| t87s Cloud | 0.3ms | 0.8ms | 500k |

Yes, we're faster than Redis for a globally distributed app. No, we didn't stack the deck in our favor. Yes, the benchmarks are open source, and you can reproduce them at your leisure.

## The API

The intelligence API has two endpoints.

**`POST /v1/issues`** - Returns detected problems, sorted by severity.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.t87s.dev/v1/issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $T87S_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "staleness:product:456",
      "type": "staleness",
      "severity": "critical",
      "key": "product:456",
      "description": "Cache key \"product:456\" has a 35.2% stale rate (352/1000 samples)",
      "detectedAt": 1706123456
    }
  ]
}
```

**`POST /v1/stats`** - Returns aggregated cache statistics.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.t87s.dev/v1/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $T87S_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "totalVerifications": 4521,
    "totalKeys": 23,
    "totalStale": 142,
    "staleRate": 0.031,
    "keyStats": [
      { "key": "user:*", "totalSamples": 1200, "staleCount": 12, "lastUpdated": 1706123456 },
      { "key": "product:*", "totalSamples": 890, "staleCount": 89, "lastUpdated": 1706123400 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Severity thresholds: **critical** (>30% stale), **warning** (>20%), **info** (>10%).

## The MCP

The MCP server exposes two tools that wrap the API above:

- **`t87s_get_stats`** - Cache verification statistics: total verifications, staleness rate, per-key breakdown.
- **`t87s_get_issues`** - Detected staleness issues. Accepts optional `severity` filter (critical, warning, info).

Add the MCP server to your IDE, then once or twice a week ask: "What cache issues do I have?" or "Show me my cache stats." or "What missing invalidation could be provoking the cache miss on users:\<id\>"

The MCP will return the raw data. From there, you can ask follow-up questions: "Which keys have the highest stale rate?" or "Should I increase the TTL on user:* keys?"

## Dumb Cache Strategy

Here's a secret: you don't have to think about tags at all.

One popular approach is "dumb cache" - wrap everything in a cache call without any tags, deploy to production, and let it run for 48-72 hours. Then, use our MCP and your coding agent to analyze your actual traffic patterns and tell you exactly which operations benefit from caching and what TTLs make sense.

## Pricing

**Free tier:** 10k operations/month. No credit card required.

**After that:** $0.001 per operation.

Let's say you have a small SaaS with 50 daily active users. Each user averages 3 sessions per day, and each session hits your cache 10 times. That's 50 × 3 × 10 = 1,500 operations per day, or about 45k per month. Subtract the 10k free tier, and you're at 35k × $0.001 = **$35/month**.

## Get Started

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { CloudAdapter } from '@t87s/core';

    const t87s = new T87s({
      adapter: new CloudAdapter({
        apiKey: process.env.T87S_API_KEY,
      }),
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    from t87s import T87s
    from t87s.adapters.cloud import CloudAdapter

    # pip install t87s[cloud]
    t87s = T87s(adapter=CloudAdapter(api_key=os.environ["T87S_API_KEY"]))
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. Same API you already know. Just faster, smarter, and with someone else waking up at 3am.
