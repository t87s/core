## Why do I need this lib?

Perhaps you don't. If your app doesn't make many DB or API calls, or if those calls are reasonably fast, you're probably fine.

Otherwise, consider using t87s. At a minimum, you can plug it into [Redis](/guides/adapters/#redisadapter) and get an amazing caching experience with a delightful DX. And for devs with little patience and an appetite for speed, you can use our [managed cloud adapter](/cloud/). Not only is it 4x faster than a Redis-based caching strategy, but it offers cache auto-tuning via [AI analysis](/cloud/#using-with-llms) based on time-series analysis of your cache.

## The name

The name **t87s** comes from a shortening of the oft-quoted phrase:

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."
> — Phil Karlton

Who wants to type that all the time? It's way easier to type `t86s`. And because no name would be complete without an off-by-one error, `t87s`.

Now, be good and [read the docs](/getting-started/).
