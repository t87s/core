## Why do I need this lib?

Perhaps you don't. If your app doesn't make many DB or API calls, or if those calls are reasonably fast, you're probably fine.

Otherwise, consider using t87s. You can plug it into Redis or our cloud adapter and get a fast cache with a delightfully small surface area. If you want the full turbo path, the cloud does auto-tuning via real-time verification and analytics.

## The name

The name **t87s** comes from a shortening of the oft-quoted phrase:

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."
> -- Phil Karlton

Who wants to type that all the time? It's way easier to type `t86s`. And because no name would be complete without an off-by-one error, `t87s`.

Now, be good and read the docs.
